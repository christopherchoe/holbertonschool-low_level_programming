* What are nested loops and how to use them

[Functions](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_functions.htm)
* What is a function and how do you use a function?
* What is the difference between a declaration and a defintion of a function?
* Scope of variables

[Function Prototype](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-purpose-of-a-function-prototype/)
* What is a prototype

[GCC](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gcc)
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra

[Headers](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_header_files.htm)
